            <p>Jazz dance that we know today developed alongside Jazz music. With prohibition in the 1920's, speakeasies and dance halls fostered a rebellious environment with moves designed to thrill the nightlife with their spontaneous and explosive kinetic chemistry. Jazz has evolved into a very clean style, with straight lines, and big energy. Jazz can be recognized largely in Broadway Musicals, most notably, Bob Fossee, pioneered his jazz style in the shows Cabaret and Chicago. Also, the Radio City Rockettes perform what people see as quinticential jazz, with their clean lines, and almost perfect technique. Jazz is all about energy, technique, and entertainment.</p>

            <p>Ballet is known to be the backbone of all dance, and most dancers will tell you that without ballet, you will not be able to do any other style. Its origins are in the Italian Renaissance, when it was developed as a court entertainment. During the 15th and 16th centuries the dance technique became formalized. The predominance of French in the vocabulary of ballet reflects this history, as the first ballet company was founded in Paris. Ballet is all about perfection, looking effortless, and storytelling. The most famous ballet performances are stories like the Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, and Romeo and Juliet.</p>

            <p>Hip-hop dance began during the late 1960's and early 1970's in the Bronx, New York City, originally inspired by the movements of African dancing, and flourished as a new style of dance performed on the street for the people. Hip-hop incorporates aspects of modern dance, tap, and swing, integrating music and complex movements to form artistry. Dances from the 1980s such as the Running Man, the Worm, and the Cabbage Patch entered the mainstream and became fad dances. Hip-hop dance is not a studio-derived style. Street dancers developed it in urban neighborhoods without a formal process. Hip Hop dance is part of a whole culture of Hip Hop, that includes Deejaying, Graffiti, Emceeing, and Breaking.</p>

            <p>Modern dance emerged as a rebellion against the rigid structures of classical ballet, pioneering freedom of expression and movement. Originating in the early 20th century, visionaries like Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham embraced individualism, emotion, and innovation. Today, modern dance continues to evolve, blending various styles and cultural influences. Performances may incorporate elements of improvisation, floor work, and partnering, allowing for a dynamic interplay between dancers and space. Choreography often explores abstract concepts or personal narratives, conveyed through a diverse range of movement styles, from flowing and lyrical to sharp and angular.</p>

            <p>Tap dancing is a percussive form of dance where dancers create rhythmic patterns with their feet, often wearing shoes with metal taps attached. It originated from a blend of African and European dance traditions in 19th-century America and has since evolved into a dynamic art form. Tap dancers use intricate footwork, syncopation, and improvisation to express themselves musically through movement, making it both a physical and auditory spectacle. It's characterized by its versatility, with styles ranging from classic Broadway tap to more contemporary and experimental forms, ensuring its enduring popularity in the dance world. Tap is timeless incorporating innovative choreography and contemporary influences to keep the tradition alive.</p>
