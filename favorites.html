                <p>This performance has been one of my favorites since it was released 6 years ago in 2018. Tessandra Chavez is an award winning choreographer, known for the emotion and story telling she puts into every piece. If you watch the dance, don't just pay attention to the cool tricks, but look at the intention behind every movie, even the stillness is captivating. Also, the dancers here are all extremely clean and precise, there are so many of them, yet they move as one.</p>

                            Your browser does not support the video tag. This is a hard hitting, group hip hop dance. It is subtle and has a lot of intricacies.

                    </div>
                    <p>I love this performance so much, because of its intricacy and subtlty. The dancers are so precise, and in unison, while performing extremely difficult moves. This hip hop dance is performed by some very famous dancers, like Josh Price, and I feel can sometimes be underappreciated because most people do not notice the small details. The dancers are able to be hard hitting, and smooth all at the same time, to make it look effortless.</p>

                        <p>Molly Long is known for her groundbreaking, out of the box, yet technically difficult choreography. These dancers use chairs as props, which is hard to begin with, but their discipline and training make it look easy. I love this dance so much because of how captivating it is to watch. You are on the edge of your seat during this piece, as every move is so powerful. Even though the dance is not extremely fast or jam packed, the dancers' execution of the movement is incredible.</p>
