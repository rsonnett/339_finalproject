                <p>Hi! My name is Rachel Sonnett, a sophmore in the School of Information at the University of Michigan on the Information Analysis track. After I graduate, I am interested in analyzing data in order to create marketing strategies for brands and businesses. I am from Los Angeles, California and have a Golden Retriever, Ringo. I love surfing and just being anywhere near the ocean, fashion, and hiking!</p>

            <h1>About Me as a Dancer</h1>

                <p> I have been a dancer since I was two years old. Dance has been my life long passion, and I am trained in Ballet, Jazz, Tap, Musical Theater, Modern, and Hip Hop. I have been apart of a dance studio up until I graduated High School where I would train for over 15 hours a week in all these styles. I would say my favorite style is either Hip Hop or contemporary. I was always pushing myself at dance, always wanting to learn the newest trick or doing an extra turn, but as I came to college, I have found choreographing and teaching to be a newfound passion. At U of M I am in a Hip Hop dance club named Encore, where I love to choreograph and be apart of the creation of our sets. Encore performs about twice a year, so I still have that in my life, but defintely not as much as I did growing up. Dance has truly made me who I am, and it has always been wehre I felt most confident, and most myself. I believe that dance is another language where people can express themselves in ways that are not possible otherwise.</p>
